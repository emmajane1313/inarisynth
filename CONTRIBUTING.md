#### Submitting a pull request

When you're ready to submit a pull request, you can follow these naming conventions:

-   Pull request titles use the  [Imperative Mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood)  (e.g.,  `Add something`,  `Fix something`).
-   [Changesets](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#versioning)  use past tense verbs (e.g.,  `Added something`,  `Fixed something`).

When you submit a pull request, GitHub will automatically lint, build, and test your changes. If you see an  ‚ùå, it's most likely a bug in your code. Please, inspect the logs through the GitHub UI to find the cause.
